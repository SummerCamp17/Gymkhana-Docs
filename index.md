## Need for the Portal

Present system of Nominations is too hectic and is difficult to monitor. Currently, the Nominations that are released 
have different platforms for different tasks. For example, the Admins first propose a nomination which is approved by 
the respective Gen-Sec. 

After getting the approval, the target audience is notified about the application process and are
required to submit their responses in Google forms which is then analysed by the admins.

Following the Interview period, the accepted nominees are notified via mail again. The compiled list of selected students is
sent to Geb-Sec after whose approval, the accepted nominees are assigned the respective post.

## About the Portal

The Nomination Portal addresses most of the issues faced during the process by integrating every functionality at one place.
Now you can see the list of Nominations for which you are eligible to apply, you can also see the status of the nominations 
that you've created, i.e List of Applicants, Approval status from your parent posts etc. 

The best feature about the portal is the ability to create Dynamic Forms. You can create Basic forms similar to Google Forms,
for pre-interview assessment. Or if you are too lazy to create a form once again, you can access the forms that you've created 
earlier (yes, they are auto-saved!). 

Other Cool features are that you can view your Post History, Nomination History, Posts that you assigned for. You can also
create a new nomination for a Post beneath you, although beware that such nominations will have to be approved by your 
parent post (If you are a Secretary trying to spam everyone, remember, coordinators are watching!!).

Also it is possible to manually add users to a post, remove them from the posts or replace the old batch with a new one. 
So yeah, the system is fool-proof ;) .
